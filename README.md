# HW4-Code-Quiz
This was the hardest homework to date. I'm sure it wont be the hardest. 

I have been unable to get my questions to popuate when I click start. 

I have the timer and the start button working. I have tried various different attempts/methods/googled but I am unable to get this working as of now. 


I have tried every way and I can not get my questions pulled in 
I added the HS and end but without the questions, it's pointless
